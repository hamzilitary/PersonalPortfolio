Contact information (link to GH, linkedin)
Your personal and work projects (Do not work on building out your projects section. Next week’s code review will have you create this section.)
Your site must include:

A landing page featuring an image of yourself or an image that expresses your style.
A blog section featuring your posts. You are not required to write any posts for this project.
Visitors to your site should be able to comment on specific blog posts you’ve made. They should also be able to see all previous comments left on blog posts. All comments should have body and author fields.

You should be able to log on/off as an administrator to your portfolio. You can choose whether to seed your database with an admin username and password, or you can include page to register. Obviously you would not want other users to be able to register and view the admin side of your site, but for this project do not worry about this. As add admin, you should be able to:

Create, update, view, and delete blog posts. Use AJAX for the GET methods for this functionality. You are not required to use AJAX to submit forms.
Create comments and view and remove comments left by you or visitors to the site.
Spend any extra time styling and personalizing your app.
Dig through the GitHub API endpoints to find the correct API call. (Hint: This call should search for repositories with stars and sort them in ascending order.) You should display the top three most starred projects in the Projects section of your Portfolio. If you do not have any starred repositories, star your favorite three.
